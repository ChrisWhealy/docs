# Packaging

Because the package manager is built on top of Docker, packaging your nanoservice is as simple as building against the
`Dockerfile` provided in the root of the nanoservice, tagging it, and pushing it to whatever resigtry you are using.
If you want to complete this example without doing this, do not worry, we have this example already packaged and
hosted on an open registry for you to use. We can cover how to install our nanoservice in the next section.
